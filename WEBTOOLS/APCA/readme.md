files for the APCA basic tool site


- index.htm — This is the main HTML page, it contains a lot of JS and CSS as well.
- JS/DEV98G_SAPCsRGB.js — this is the SAPC engine, note this is a little different than the npm package for apca-w3
- CSS/style.0.0.98-g.css — the main style sheet, but note that there are a lot of styles in the main page as well.

Please present changes as a new branch, and thank you!
